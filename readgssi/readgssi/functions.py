    """
    Logic to figure out how to set zoom extents. If specified limits are out of bounds, they are set back to boundary extents. If limits of a specified axis are equal, they are expanded to the full extent of that axis.

    :param list[int,int,int,int] zoom: Zoom extents to set programmatically for matplotlib plots. Must pass a list of four integers: :py:data:`[left, right, up, down]`. Since the z-axis begins at the top, the "up" value is actually the one that displays lower on the page. All four values are axis units, so if you are working in nanoseconds, 10 will set a limit 10 nanoseconds down. If your x-axis is in seconds, 6 will set a limit 6 seconds from the start of the survey. It may be helpful to display the matplotlib interactive window at full extents first, to determine appropriate extents to set for this parameter. If extents are set outside the boundaries of the image, they will be set back to the boundaries. If two extents on the same axis are the same, the program will default to plotting full extents for that axis.
    :param list[int,int,int,int] extent: Full extent boundaries of the image, in the style :py:data:`[left, right, up, down]`.
