This program was written to read and process ground-penetrating radar files from instruments made by Geophysical Survey Systems Incorporated (GSSI), although I have no affiliation with nor endorsement for the afforementioned organization.

The demands of ice- and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveying, as in many types of scientific fieldwork, require that both quality control and time savings are critical to a successful field campaign. This software provides a way to quickly read, process, and display radar data produced by GSSI radar antennas and control units. GSSI's own RADAN software is bulky, closed-source, non-free, and not meant to handle folders full of GPR data files at once. `readgssi` was designed to be used in the field to quality-check entire folders of data files by converting radar profiles to portable network graphics (PNG) images, saving users valuable time versus performing the equivalent actions by hand in RADAN, especially in the case of projects with large file counts.

`readgssi` has the capability to read DZT and DZG files with the same pre-extension name and plot the data contained in those files. `readgssi` is also currently able to translate most DZT files to CSV and [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) binary (see [future](#future)). The file read parameters are based on GSSI's DZT file description, similar to the ones available on pages 55-57 of the [SIR-3000 manual](https://support.geophysical.com/gssiSupport/Products/Documents/Control%20Unit%20Manuals/GSSI%20-%20SIR-3000%20Operation%20Manual.pdf). File structure is, unfortunately, prone to change at any time, and although I've been able to test with files from several systems, I have not encountered every iteration of file header yet. If you run into trouble, please [create a github issue](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/issues).

Full documentation, including a tutorial, is available at https://readgssi.readthedocs.io.

Questions, feature requests, and bugs: please [open a github issue](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/issues). Kindly provide the error output, describe what you are attempting to do, and attach the DZT/DZG file(s) causing you trouble.

```

From a unix command line:
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT
```
Simply specifying an input DZT file like in the above command (`-i file`) will display a host of data about the file including:
- name of GSSI control unit
- antenna model
- antenna frequency
- samples per trace
- bits per sample
- traces per second
- L1 dielectric as entered during survey
- sampling depth
- speed of wave at given dielectric
- number of traces
- number of seconds

## basic functionality
### CSV output
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o test.csv -f CSV
```
Translates radar data array to CSV format, if that's your cup of tea. One might use this to export to Matlab. One CSV will be written per channel. The script will rename the output to 'test_100MHz.csv' automatically. No header information is included in the CSV.

```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -s 8 -r 0 -o test.csv -f CSV
```
Applies 8x stacking, and background removal filters before exporting to CSV (see explanations below).

### DZT output (experimental)
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -R -Z 0 -o test.DZT -f DZT
```
This exports the array as a second DZT file after reversing the direction of the survey line.

The following operations will stick when writing files:
- stacking
- filtering
- distance normalization
- reversing direction
- zero (top of array will be shaved off; to avoid this, set `-Z 0`. this will be fixed in the future.)
- manually setting header values, ror example samples per meter (`-d 10`), epsilon_r (`-E 3.1`), and antenna frequency (`-a 100`)

The following operations will **not** stick:
- absolute value of gradient
- gain
- zoom
- plot features like axis units (obviously)

Please note the following about DZT output:

- While DZTs will be written, there will be no accompanying DZX written. This functionality may be implemented in the future but for now is a bit too complex of an operation for readgssi. This could have consequences if you're planning to re-import to RADAN after this operation.
- **Single channel files only** are supported at this time. Multi-channel files will be written but the values on the second channel will not be correct. If you wish to use readgssi to re-write multiple channels, you will have to separate the channels using RADAN or another software first.

### numpy object output
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o test.npy -f numpy
```
This command will save the array in numpy binary format. Header information will not be saved, however.

### [`GPRPy`](https://github.com/NSGeophysics/gprpy)-compatible output
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o test -f gprpy
```
This command saves the array in numpy binary format, and preserves the header as a JSON file as well. [`GPRPy`](https://github.com/NSGeophysics/gprpy) will soon support importing this type of file.


### plotting
#### example 1A: without gain
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1a.png -p 5 -s auto
```
The above command will cause `readgssi` to save and show a plot named "DZT__001c0Tz233S6G1.png" with a y-size of 5 inches at 150 dpi (`-p 5`) and the autostacking algorithm will stack the x-axis to some multiple of times shorter than the original data array for optimal viewing on a monitor, approximately 2.5\*y (`-s auto`). The plot will be rendered in the `gray` color scheme.
![Example 1a](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/1a.png)

#### example 1B: with gain
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1b.png -p 5 -s auto -g 60 -r 75
```
This will cause `readgssi` to create a plot from the same file, but matplotlib will save the plot as "1b.png" (`-o 1b.png`). The script will plot the y-axis size (`-p 5`) and automatically stack the x-axis to (`-s auto`). The script will plot the data with a gain value of 50 (`-g 50`), which will increase the plot contrast by a factor of 50. Next `readgssi` will run the background removal (`-r 75`) filter. (To apply this horizontal background removal filter across the entire line horizontally, use `-r 0`. More about this in examples [2b](#example-2b-horizontal-mean-bgr-algorithm-applied) and [2c](#example-2c-moving-window-horizontal-mean).)
![Example 1b](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/1b.png)

#### example 1C: display the vertical axis in meters and manually set the Epsilon_r
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1c.png -p 5 -s auto -g 60 -r 75 -z m -E 80
```
This will set the Epsilon_râ€”that is, the relative permittivity of the first layer mediumâ€”to 80 (`-E 80`) and the Z axis to meters (`-z m`). The resulting plot will have a depth scale in meters.
Epsilon_r should be set in the header, but if it is set incorrectly, this is the way to adjust it on the fly.
![Example 1c](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/1c.png)

#### example 1D: make a high-quality figure
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1d.png -p 5 -s auto -g 60 -r 75 -z m -E 80 -T -D 300
```
Okay, now our figure looks great and we want to put it in a publication! Time to turn off the title (`-T`) and pump up the DPI to printer quality (`-D 300`). For AGU poster-quality images, you may even need `-D 600`.
One tricky thing to keep in mind is that the smaller the plot size (`-p`) the larger the relative size of the text in the figure.
![Example 1d](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/1d.png)

#### example 1E: changing colormaps and gain settings
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1e.png -p 5 -s auto -g 20 -r 75 -z m -E 80 -c seismic
```
Here, a horizontal background removal is applied, but gain is turned down (`-g 20`). The script uses matplotlib's "seismic" colormap (`-c seismic`) which is specifically designed for this type of waterfall array plotting. Even without gain, you will often be able to easily see very slight signal perturbations. Given its use of red, however, it is not terribly colorblind-friendly for either of the two most common types of human colorblindness, which is why it is not used as the default colormap.
![Example 1e](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/1e.png)

#### example 1F: absolute value of vertical gradient
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1f.png -p 5 -s auto -g 100 -r 75 -z m -E 80 -c gray_r -A -t 80-120
```
While we're on the topic of colormaps, it's worth pointing out that you can tell readgssi to calculate the vertical derivative (the "gradient") of the profile and display its absolute value using the `-A` flag. This gradient display is a good way to highlight areas of polarity change regardless of positive or negative values. It is particularly useful for highlighting glacial bed material through ice, for example. Here (in a lake profile) we set both `-A` to plot the absolute value of vertical gradient and also a FIR filter (`-t 80-120`) explained [below](#example-2d-vertical-triangular-fir-filter). We also set the colormap to the reverse of the usual one (`-c gray_r`) so that black indicates high values.
![Example 1f](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/1f.png)

### filtering

Each of the plots in this section is displayed with a histogram to illustrate changing array values.

#### example 2A: no background removal
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2a.png -p 5 -s auto -g 30 -m
```
Sometimes, files will look "washed out" due to a skew relative to the mean of the data. This is easily correctable. Here `readgssi` will create a plot of size 5 and stack 5x (`-p 5 -s 5`). Matplotlib will use the default "gray" colormap and save a PNG of the figure, but the script will suppress the matplotlib window (using the `-n` flag, useful for processing an entire directory full of DZTs at once). Finally, the `-m` flag will draw a histogram for each data channel. Note how the histogram changes when filters are applied.
![Example 2a](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2a.png)
![Example 2a histogram](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2a-h.png)

#### example 2B: horizontal mean BGR algorithm applied
The flag to get rid of the skew (or any horizontally uniform noise) is `-r`, also known as background removal or BGR for short. `-r` has two modes, one set by `-r 0` and one set when the option after the `-r` flag is greater than zero. When this BGR option is zero, the program simply subtracts the average of each profile row from the array. When it's greater than 0, `readgssi` will implement a moving window mean, the size of which is set in **post-stack** traces (see [example 2C](#example-2c-moving-window-horizontal-mean)).

The command below does the same thing as [example 2A](#example-2a-no-background-removal), except `-r 0` applies full width horizontal mean background removal to the profile. Note the difference in ringing artifacts and skew between examples 2a and 2b.
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2b.png -p 5 -s auto -g 30 -m -r 0
```
![Example 2b](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2b.png)
![Example 2b histogram](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2b-h.png)

#### example 2C: moving window horizontal mean

```bash
readgssi -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2c.png -p 5 -s auto -g 30 -m -r 75
```
Same as above but with a 75-trace wide moving window mean (`-r 75`). This width represents post-stack traces. This is, for all intents and purposes, the same as RADAN's "BOXCAR" method of horizontal noise removal, but much, much faster because it's [implemented with scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.uniform_filter1d.html). Areas beyond the left and right edges are treated as zeros. Notice that the noise in the water column is nearly entirely wiped out, but real data is extended with lateral wisps the size of half of the window, which is a side-effect of this method. Note that the histogram (`-m`) has a fairly even distribution around the mean, which generally indicates that the image should be fairly readable.

![Example 2c](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2c.png)
![Example 2c histogram](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2c-h.png)

#### example 2D: vertical triangular FIR filter

```bash
readgssi -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2d.png -p 5 -s auto -g 30 -m -t 80-120
```
This function is functionally the same as RADAN's vertical triangular FIR filter, but again [implemented with scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.firwin.html#scipy.signal.firwin). It is used to filter out unwanted frequencies on a per-shot basis, which makes it very effective as a profile cleaning tool. The most effective results are achieved by filtering a tight window of frequencies around the center frequency of the antenna you are using. In this case, we are using a 100 MHz antenna and filtering from 80-120 MHz.

![Example 2d](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2d.png)
![Example 2d histogram](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2d-h.png)

#### example 2E: combining filters for a cleaner profile

```bash
readgssi -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2e.png -p 5 -s auto -g 30 -m -r 75 -t 80-120
```
In this example, we use two concurrent filters (the horizontal windowed BGR and the vertical triangular FIR) to try and clean the image up as much as possible without overcooking it.

![Example 2e](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2e.png)
![Example 2e histogram](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2e-h.png)

### array manipulation
#### example 3A: (without) distance normalization
The default behavior of `readgssi` is to plot the X-axis in survey time units (seconds). This can be changed using the `-x` flag. To display in distance units, you must either have GPS information in DZG format, or specify the number of radar traces per meter using the `-d` flag. `-d 24 -x meters` will change the traces per meter value in the header to 24.0 and display the profile with distance in meters along the X-axis.

Files with GPS information are handled in a slightly different way. First, `readgssi` will read a DZG file to create an array of distance information associated with marks in the DZT. *(NOTE: If your project was recorded without DZG files but you have per-line GPS mark information in GPX format, please look at [gpx2dzg](https://github.com/iannesbitt/gpx2dzg) for a method of creating a DZG file for each survey line)* After reading the DZG, the program will expand or contract the GPR array based on the speed over ground between GPS points. It will then modify the traces per meter value from the header and display the profile with distance on the X-axis.

Here a file is processed and displayed without distance normalization:
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__003.DZT -o 3a.png -p 5 -s auto -r 0 -g 60
```
![Example 3a](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/3a.png)

#### example 3B: distance normalization using a DZG file

To use DZG GPS information to distance normalize the profile and display in meters traveled, use the `-N` and `-x meters` flags. `readgssi` will normalize the file in chunks to reduce memory usage. Here is the same file with distance normalization applied:

```bash
readgssi -i DZT__003.DZT -o 3b.png -p 5 -s auto -r 0 -g 60 -N -x meters
```
![Example 3b](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/3b.png)

#### example 3c: reverse line direction

A simple but sometimes necessary operation is flipping a survey line back to front in order to display it congruently with others in a set. This can be done easily using `-R`.

![Example 3b](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/3c.png)


## advanced usage

UNIX users have a distinct advantage of being able to easily process entire folders full of DZTs with a simple command. Users who wish to do this should [read up](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-for-loop/) on how to construct `for` loops in Bash or simply follow and modify these examples below.

### processing all files in a folder

This command makes use of the `ls` function in Bash, which lists all files that match a specific pattern. In this case, we want the pattern to be "any DZT file," which ends up being simply `ls *.DZT` (the `*` symbol is a wildcard, meaning it matches any set of characters, so in this case it would match both `FILE____005.DZT` and `test.DZT` but not `Test01.dzt` because the `.DZT` is case sensitive.).

```bash
for f in `ls *.DZT`; do readgssi -p 8 -n -r 0 -g 40 -Z 233 -z ns -N -x m -s auto -i $f; done
```

The structure of this command is easy to understand if you know a little bit about `for` loops. This command loops over every file with the extension `.DZT` (`ls *.DZT` where `*` indicates a wildcard) and assigns the filename to the `f` variable on each loop. Then, after the semicolon, bash runs readgssi for every pass of the loop. In this case, the parameters are:

```bash
-p 8    # plot with size 8
-n      # suppress the matplotlib window; useful if you do not want the operation interrupted by plot windows
-r 0    # full-width background removal
-g 40   # gain of 40
-Z 233  # time zero at 233 samples
-z ns   # display the depth axis in nanoseconds
-N      # distance-normalize the profile
-x m    # display the x-axis in meters
-s auto # apply automatic stacking
-i $f   # recall the `f` variable containing this loop's filename and feed it to the input flag of readgssi
```

Finally, end the loop by closing the command with a linebreak `;`, and the `done` marker.

### processing specific sets of files
You can make the command even more specific by further modifying the set of files returned by the `ls` command. For example:

```bash
for f in `ls FILE__{010..025}.DZT`; do readgssi -p 8 -n -r 0 -g 40 -Z 233 -z ns -N -x m -s auto -i $f; done
```

This command will process only the 16 files in the numeric sequence between and including `010` and `025` in the set (`FILE__010.DZT`, `FILE__011.DZT`, `...`, `FILE__025.DZT`). `bash` handles the zero padding for you as well. Pretty cool.

### citation suggestion:
Ian M. Nesbitt, FranÃ§ois-Xavier Simon, Thomas Paulin, 2018. readgssi - an open-source tool to read and plot GSSI ground-penetrating radar data. [doi:10.5281/zenodo.1439119](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1439119)

#### known bugs:
- scipy 1.2.x causes errors when filtering. use scipy 1.3.0 to avoid.

## future
- automatic script testing for smoother dev
- create a class for surveyline objects, similar to [`obspy.core.trace.Trace`](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Trace.html)
- GPS transcription from CSV with fields like `mark name, lon, lat, elev, time`
- ability to use GPS altitude to adjust z position across profile
- ability to ground truth depths as horizontal lines
- GUI-based geologic/dielectric layer picking
  - layer velocity calculation (using minimum of clustered hyperbola tail angle measurements, or manual input)
  - velocity-based depth adjustments
  - ability to incorporate ground truth measurements
- velocity gradient/angle of incidence-based array migration
- translation to common geophysical formats (HDF5, SEGY, etc.)
- integration with [`vista`](https://docs.pyvista.org) for 3D visualization of location-aware arrays
